<pre class="ascii-callout">
>> ARE YOU OUT THERE?

Disenchanted thinkers.  
Runaways from institutions.  
Philosophers with unfinished manifestos.  
Artists without grants.  
Coders who stayed up all night just to build a void.  
Radio ghosts, fringe theorists, off-grid dwellers.

We see you.

This isn’t a collective. It’s a signal.  
This isn’t a brand. It’s a refusal.

Here lies BRUT.  
A zone of deliberate noise.  
A playground for post-human gestures, experimental systems, and illegible truths.

No optimization. No hustle. No feed.
